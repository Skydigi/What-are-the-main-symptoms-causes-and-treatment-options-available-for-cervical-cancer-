Cervical cancer develops in the cells of the cervix and is often linked to persistent HPV infection. Common symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding (between periods or after intercourse), unusual discharge, pelvic pain, and discomfort during intimacy. The causes are mainly related to HPV, smoking, weakened immunity, and poor reproductive health. Early detection through Pap smears and HPV testing is crucial. Treatment depends on the stage of cancer and may include surgery (like hysterectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Preventive measures such as HPV vaccination and regular screenings play an important role in reducing risk. Timely medical consultation helps in improving survival rates and quality of life.
